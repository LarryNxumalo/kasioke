# Music Player With Lyrics Synchronization (Musixmatch)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/jewel998/pen/GRRPExw](https://codepen.io/jewel998/pen/GRRPExw).

This is a music player, with linear side translating playlist menu with active search and repeat options and then its syncs with the lyrics according to the data on my github profile.

If you want to help me grow, follow me and share some ideas about what to develop next.
Thanks. Happy Developing.
